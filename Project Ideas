*Take standard mpg data set used for python training and chart out differences in fuel efficiency based on standard expectations 
(vehicle weight, engine parameters, etc)
  *Follow up with finding other data sets that might help explain the differences (aerodynamic design, drive train efficiency, etc.)
*Learn about gasoline efficiencies.
  *What are the effects of regulations in different states
  *Does higher octane gasoline lead to more miles per gallon?
  *What is the price difference in gasoline grades where higher octane is worth it?
